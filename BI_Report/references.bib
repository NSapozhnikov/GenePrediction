  title    = "Tardigrades in space research - past and future",
  author   = "Erdmann, Weronika and Kaczmarek, {\L}ukasz",
  abstract = "To survive exposure to space conditions, organisms should have
              certain characteristics including a high tolerance for freezing,
              radiation and desiccation. The organisms with the best chance for
              survival under such conditions are extremophiles, like some
              species of Bacteria and Archea, Rotifera, several species of
              Nematoda, some of the arthropods and Tardigrada (water bears).
              There is no denying that tardigrades are one of the toughest
              animals on our planet and are the most unique in the
              extremophiles group. Tardigrada are very small animals (50 to
              2,100 $\mu$m in length), and they inhabit great number of Earth
              environments. Ever since it was proven that tardigrades have high
              resistance to the different kinds of stress factors associated
              with cosmic journeys, combined with their relatively complex
              structure and their relative ease of observation, they have
              become a perfect model organism for space research. This taxon is
              now the focus of astrobiologists from around the world.
              Therefore, this paper presents a short review of the space
              research performed on tardigrades as well as some considerations
              for further studies.",
