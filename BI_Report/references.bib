  author   = "Erdmann, Weronika and Kaczmarek, {\L}ukasz",
  abstract = "To survive exposure to space conditions, organisms should have
              certain characteristics including a high tolerance for freezing,
              radiation and desiccation. The organisms with the best chance for
              survival under such conditions are extremophiles, like some
              species of Bacteria and Archea, Rotifera, several species of
              Nematoda, some of the arthropods and Tardigrada (water bears).
              There is no denying that tardigrades are one of the toughest
              animals on our planet and are the most unique in the
              extremophiles group. Tardigrada are very small animals (50 to
              2,100 $\mu$m in length), and they inhabit great number of Earth
              environments. Ever since it was proven that tardigrades have high
              resistance to the different kinds of stress factors associated
              with cosmic journeys, combined with their relatively complex
              structure and their relative ease of observation, they have
              become a perfect model organism for space research. This taxon is
              now the focus of astrobiologists from around the world.
              Therefore, this paper presents a short review of the space
              research performed on tardigrades as well as some considerations
              for further studies.",

	abstract = {In bioinformatics, machine learning methods have been used to predict features embedded in the sequences. In contrast to what is generally assumed, machine learning approaches can also provide new insights into the underlying biology. Here, we demonstrate this by presenting TargetP 2.0, a novel state-of-the-art method to identify N-terminal sorting signals, which direct proteins to the secretory pathway, mitochondria, and chloroplasts or other plastids. By examining the strongest signals from the attention layer in the network, we find that the second residue in the protein, that is, the one following the initial methionine, has a strong influence on the classification. We observe that two-thirds of chloroplast and thylakoid transit peptides have an alanine in position 2, compared with 20\% in other plant proteins. We also note that in fungi and single-celled eukaryotes, less than 30\% of the targeting peptides have an amino acid that allows the removal of the N-terminal methionine compared with 60\% for the proteins without targeting peptide. The importance of this feature for predictions has not been highlighted before.},
